# BlackScholesModel
Black-Scholes-Merton model for options pricing.
Black-Scholes equation was first transformed into the form of the heat equation, then solved implicitly using the Crank-Nicolson method. Central difference approximation in stock price and forward difference approximation in time were also used to solve the equation explicitly as a comparison to the implicit method.
